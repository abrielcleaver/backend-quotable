# Abriel's Backend Quotable

### Description

My task is to create a Futurama profile directory API. Each profile contains a `name` (a person's name) and a `quote`. The `name` should come from the request body. The `quote` should be randomly generated using the Futurama API. You can `fetch` a single quote from the Futurama API by making a `GET` request to `https://futuramaapi.herokuapp.com/api/quotes/1`.

Organize fetch request & model method calls in the `ProfileService.js`.
